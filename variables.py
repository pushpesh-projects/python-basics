"""
Each variable must have a unique name - an identifier.

A legal identifier name must be a non-empty sequence of characters,
must begin with the underscore(_), or a letter,
and it cannot be a Python keyword.

The first character may be followed by underscores, letters, and digits.
Identifiers in Python are case-sensitive.

Python is a dynamically-typed language,
which means you don't need to declare variables in it.

To assign values to variables,you can use a simple assignment operator
in the form of the equal (=) sign, i.e.,var = 1.

You can combine text and variables using the + operator,
and use the print() function to output strings and variables,

You can also use compound assignment operators (shortcut operators)
to modify values assigned to variables,
var = var / 2 ⇒ var /= 2
rem = rem % 10 ⇒ rem %= 10
i = i + 2 * j ⇒ i += 2 * j
j = j - (i + var + rem) ⇒ j -= (i + var + rem)
x = x ** 2 ⇒ x **= 2
